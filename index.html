						<p class="description">Hello, friend, and welcome to my site. I am Jesus Alatorre, a software engineer in training. Born (9/11/1995) and raised in sunny Monterrey, Mexico, where I currently study. I love coding, coffee, dogs, home-cooked meals, science fiction, gadgetry, and teamwork. I consider myself calm, collected, and generally quiet, but not at all shy.</p>

						<p> I believe engineering is all about the observation of the natural world, and using our understanding of it to develop tools for the benefit of humanity. Hence, I believe the computer is the pinnacle of all human engineering, the most advanced tool we possess, and our most powerful ally. To make advances in the field of computation is to push forward the human race itself. I aspire to someday be a part of this driving force, to work among peers that I can learn from and can, in turn, learn from me.  </p>
